# JavascriptCalculator
The calculator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The JavaScript Calculator is a simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows users to input numerical values and perform calculations on the fly without the need for page refresh.

The HTML file contains the structure of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons for numbers and operations. The CSS file provides styling to make the calculator visually appealing and user-friendly. The JavaScript file handles the logic for capturing button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the display screen accordingly.
